set to react 17.0.2

Create 2 (two) React projects:
1 (one) React project should be made in VSCode using CRA (create-react-app)
1 (one) React project should use codesandbox

With both React projects do the following:
Remove the rendered boilerplate code completely. This will allow you to return only the values.
Return 2 (two) h1 tags and some text with each

Additional practice: do NOT use any JSX to log the same return values as above, but in the virtual dom structure.

Redo Instructions:
Though functional components are used most often in modern react development, there are still code bases that use class based components (whether legacy or for lifecycle optimization). Please do this assignment using class-based components.
