set to react 17.0.2

Create an application that does the following with SWAPI https://www.swapi.tech

A Users component that:
when mounted will provide a list of several users from the SWAPI database
Turns each user's name into a link
When the user's link is clicked create a User component that
When mounted will provide the name of the user
A button that states "Show Home Planet" that when clicked:
will render a "loading..." text that replaces the button (so the user can not spam the button)
will render the name of the Home Planet the user is from. This rendered Home planet text will replace the "loading..." text
